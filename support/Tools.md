Tool info

## Brush

Draws an area in a colour which can be used to draw:

- the sea
- rivers
- roads
- forest
- desert
- patches of colour

This will need to have a colour selector and brush size.

## Object

Draws a single object in place. Objects will include:

- mountains
- hills
- cities / towns
- trees
- other landmarks

This will allow the user to select an object.

## Field

The field tool allows the user to draw an area which is then automatically filled with an object type. The objects which can be filled will be relevant objects from the **Object** list.

## Pan

Pans the map. No other options. This should be the default tool.

## Move

Moves an object or text on the map.

## Delete

Deletes a single object or text from the map.

## Text

Allows the user to type in text on the map. This will allow the user to select different fonts and font sizes, depending on the theme used. Themes should probably limit to one or two fonts.
