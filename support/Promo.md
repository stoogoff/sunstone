### Sunstone (Looking for feedback)

[Sunstone](http://sunstone.stoogoff.com/) is a prototype of a map making tool that I've been working on. I use it for quick region maps for RPGs but I'm planning on expanding it so it'll draw city / building maps as well.

I'm not sure if this is the worst place to post this, because everyone draws such beautiful maps and would never need a tool like this, or the best place because everyone knows the kind of things they'd need to make this useful.

If you've got any feedback I'd love to hear it.

Thanks for your time!

I'm looking for feedback on Sunstone (http://sunstone.stoogoff.com/) a map making tool which I've been working on. Would be useful for role-players, possibly authors, anyone who is building a world. I use it for quick region maps for RPGs and I'm planning on expanding it so it'll draw city / interior maps as well. The artwork definitely needs improving, and I want to add different themes and art styles as part of that. If you've got any feedback I'd love to hear it.|
