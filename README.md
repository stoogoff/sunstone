# Sunstone

Sunstone is a simple to use map drawing tool aimed at role players, authors and potentially publishers.

## Features

### Layers

Each terrain type is drawn to its own layer. Layers can be reordered and hidden in the layers tab. Use the check boxes to hide or show a layer. Click and drag a layer to reorder it. Layers can only be dragged within their own group, so the Water layer can only be dragged within the terrain group.

### Autosave

Your map is saved every ten seconds so if you close your browser and revisit **Sunstone** your previous map will be restored. Currently only one map can be saved.

## Tools

Below is a list of tools available and how to use them. Tools highlighted red are a work in progress.

### Pan

Use the pan tool to click and drag around the map.

### Zoom

Use the zoom tool to zoom in and out on specific areas. You can zoom to a fixed level via the first drop down box or set the zoom direction using the second drop down box. Clicking and dragging a line across the map will zoom in or out depending on the zoom direction.

### Background

Use the background tool to change the background colour of the map.

### Line

Use the line tool to draw a free-hand line. You can select the terrain type (e.g. Water) using the first drop down box and the size of the line using the second drop down box.

### Area

Use the area tool to draw shapes. You can select the terrain type (e.g. Water) using the first drop down box and the style of the shape using the second drop down box. Smooth style will add curves to the shape, line style keeps the edges as you draw them. Click the points of the shape you want to draw and double click to close it off.

### Feature

Use the feature tool to draw terrain images such as mountains. The terrain type can be selected using the drop down box.

### Field

Use the field tool to draw an area of terrain images all at once. The terrain type can be selected using the drop down box. Click the points of the shape you want to draw and double click to close it off. Currently the field tool draws the terrain images along the edge of the area you have drawn. In future versions it will in the middle of the area as well.

### Text

Use the text tool to add or edit text labels. The style of the text can be selected using the drop down box. Clicking anywhere on the map will display a text box which you can type in. Clicking the green check button will add the text to the map. Clicking the grey cross will discard your changes. Moving your cursor over existing text will highlight it green. Clicking on highlighted text will allow you to edit it.

### Edit

Use the edit tool to modify terrain drawn with the line or area tools. Moving your cursor over a terrain item will display the points used to draw it. Click and drag to move one of these points. Clicking on the edge of the shape or the centre of the line will add a new edit point. Double clicking on an existing edit point will remove it from the shape or line.

### Move

Use the move tool to move any text or terrain features by clicking on the object and dragging it. The object to be moved will be highlighted green when your cursor is over it.

### Delete

Use the delete tool to remove any text or terrain features by clicking on the object. The object to be removed will be highlighted red when your cursor is over it.

### Clear All

Use the clear all tool to remove *all* features on the map. This will completely clear the map and can't be undone.

### Download

Use the download tool to download a copy of your map as a PNG image. Currently the download tool will only create an image of what is shown on the screen at the time. Future versions will give you more control over which areas of the map are saved to the image.
